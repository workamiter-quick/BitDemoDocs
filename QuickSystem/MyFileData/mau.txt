Hi,

As per our telephonic coversation regarding moving to a new country about the expenses & all.

let me put my views that,I have already resigned from my current Comapny and very much interested to work with u all,but when I discussed around more than 10 people who are already in Bahrain including my sister too, about the cost of living and other important amenities to live with a family of 4.

According to them 1100 BD is good salary but only for single person, they all suggested me that to fulfill all your basic needs you should have atleast minimum of 1400BD salary per month. 

After thinking about more than 50 times in terms of saving , I can't save not more than 200BD per month which is much much less to my present savings.

Please Re-think about it.


Thanks & Regards
Amit Sinha
